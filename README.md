# Undirected-Graph-Analysis
This project implements a C-based program to generate a random undirected graph with nnn vertices using an adjacency matrix. It computes the degree of each vertex and the total number of edges by applying the handshaking theorem, demonstrating its validity in practice. The project also enables basic time complexity analysis of the graph operations.
