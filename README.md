# Undirected-Graph-Analysis

This project is developed in **C language** as part of the **CSE106: Discrete Mathematics** course.  
It focuses on generating and analyzing a **random undirected graph** using an **adjacency matrix** representation.

The project demonstrates fundamental graph theory concepts, particularly the **Handshaking Theorem**, and provides insight into **vertex degree calculation, edge counting, and time complexity analysis**.

## 📌 Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:

- Generate a **random undirected graph** for any given number of vertices `n`
- Represent the graph using an **adjacency matrix**
- Determine:
  - The **degree of each vertex**
  - The **total number of edges**
- Verify the **Handshaking Theorem**
- Analyze the **time complexity** of the implemented approach

This project helps in understanding how theoretical discrete mathematics concepts are applied through practical programming.
